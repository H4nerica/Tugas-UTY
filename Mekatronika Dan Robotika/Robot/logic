okay now i want you to make a code like this. robot i had ultrasonic on front ir side. so if no wall or both wall on side. foward. and if both or no wall but wall front on 20cm. move little bit like move bit stop check move bit stop check until 10cm. then then it just stop like thinking eh? lol. and after that do the turn to the side with no wall. or if there is no wall on both side turn left basic maze solver logic right?. okay after turn  stop again check front. and repeat the logic again. and btw since after it turn it for example to the left it detect the front no wall, right wall now before it was front. and left no wall maybe avoid going back to the left since that was the path before right?. so maybe move foward until it sense both side wall again. or if  it doesnt sence the side wall on the left only turn again if there is a wall on the front. and repeat the first logic
